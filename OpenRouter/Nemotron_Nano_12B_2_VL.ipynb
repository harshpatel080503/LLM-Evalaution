    "NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2 VL is a 12-billion-parameter open multimodal reasoning model designed for video understanding and document intelligence. It introduces a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture, combining transformer-level accuracy with Mamba’s memory-efficient sequence modeling for significantly higher throughput and lower latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model supports inputs of text and multi-image documents, producing natural-language outputs. It is trained on high-quality NVIDIA-curated synthetic datasets optimized for optical-character recognition, chart reasoning, and multimodal comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nemotron Nano 2 VL achieves leading results on OCRBench v2 and scores ≈ 74 average across MMMU, MathVista, AI2D, OCRBench, OCR-Reasoning, ChartQA, DocVQA, and Video-MME—surpassing prior open VL baselines. With Efficient Video Sampling (EVS), it handles long-form videos while reducing inference cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-weights, training data, and fine-tuning recipes are released under a permissive NVIDIA open license, with deployment supported across NeMo, NIM, and major inference runtimes."

      "- *Toby narrates:* \"Every morning, I pop up my humans with the crispiest toast! Today, though, I’m on a mission—to see what’s *really* beyond this kitchen!\"  \n",

      "**Inciting Incident:** A loud *BOOM* cracks the ceiling. Lights out.  \n",
      "**Action:** Toby’s human, *Mom*, stumbles down to the kitchen, clutching a flashlight. She slips—cutting her ankle on a crystal. Toby lunges to save her finger on a breadboard, toasting it to a perfect heal.  \n",
