      "Here's a simple explanation of the Theory of Relativity, focusing on the core ideas without complex math:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it as two interconnected ideas about how space, time, and gravity work:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Special Relativity (1905):**\n",
      "    *   **Core Idea:** The laws of physics (especially electromagnetism) are the same for everyone, *regardless* of how fast they're moving, as long as they're moving at a constant speed in a straight line (no acceleration).\n",
      "    *   **The Key Discovery:** The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for everyone, no matter how fast they're moving towards or away from the light source. This is about 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/s).\n",
      "    *   **What This Means (Mind-Bending Consequences):**\n",
      "        *   **Time Dilation:** If you're moving very fast relative to someone else (close to the speed of light), time passes slower for *you* than it does for them. (Think of the \"twin paradox\": one twin travels in a fast spaceship and comes back younger than the twin who stayed on Earth).\n",
      "        *   **Length Contraction:** Objects moving very fast relative to you appear shorter in the direction they're moving.\n",
      "        *   **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²):** Mass and energy are interchangeable. A tiny amount of mass contains a huge amount of energy (like in nuclear power or the sun).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **General Relativity (1915):**\n",
      "    *   **Core Idea:** Gravity isn't a mysterious \"force\" pulling things together. Instead, it's the result of **mass and energy warping the fabric of space and time** around them.\n",
      "    *   **The Key Concept:** Imagine space and time as a giant, flexible trampoline. If you place a heavy object (like a bowling ball) on it, it creates a dip or curve. A smaller object (like a marble) rolled near the dip will naturally roll *towards* the bowling ball, not because of a direct pull, but because it's following the curve of the trampoline.\n",
      "    *   **What This Means (Mind-Bending Consequences):**\n",
      "        *   **Gravity as Curvature:** Planets orbit stars because they're moving along the curved paths (\"geodesics\") created by the star's mass warping spacetime. You feel gravity because you're moving along the curve of spacetime caused by the Earth's mass.\n",
      "        *   **Light Bending:** Light rays (which normally travel in straight lines) bend when they pass near a massive object like the Sun. This was famously confirmed during a solar eclipse.\n",
      "        *   **Time Dilation (Again):** Gravity also affects time. Time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields. Clocks tick slightly slower on Earth's surface than they do on a mountain top (though the difference is tiny).\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Simple Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Special Relativity:** The speed of light is constant for everyone. This leads to time and space being relative to your motion. Mass and energy are equivalent.\n",
      "*   **General Relativity:** Gravity is not a force, but the warping of space and time caused by mass and energy. Objects (and light) move along the curves created by this warping.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:** Special Relativity tells us how things behave when they're moving fast *through* space and time. General Relativity tells us how mass and energy *shape* space and time itself, and how that shape *creates* the force we call gravity. Together, they revolutionized our understanding of the universe.\n"
