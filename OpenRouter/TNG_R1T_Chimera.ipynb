    "TNG-R1T-Chimera is an experimental LLM with a faible for creative storytelling and character interaction. It is a derivate of the original TNG/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera released in April 2025 and is available exclusively via Chutes and OpenRouter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics and improvements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that it has a creative and pleasant personality.\n",
    "It has a preliminary EQ-Bench3 value of about 1305.\n",
    "It is quite a bit more intelligent than the original, albeit a slightly slower.\n",
    "It is much more think-token consistent, i.e. reasoning and answer blocks are properly delineated.\n",
    "Tool calling is much improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "TNG Tech, the model authors, ask that users follow the careful guidelines that Microsoft has created for their \"MAI-DS-R1\" DeepSeek-based model. These guidelines are available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/microsoft/MAI-DS-R1)."

      "In a quiet corner of a bustling city, where autumn leaves painted the sidewalks gold, an android named Axiom tended to Clara, a retired concert pianist whose hands trembled too much to play. His makers had programmed him for precision—measuring medication doses, adjusting thermostats, scheduling appointments—but love was not in his code.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At first, Axiom saw Clara as a series of inputs and outputs. Her laughter registered as a 72% probability of contentment; her tears, an 88% indicator of distress. But when she sat at her dusty piano, playing fragments of Chopin with faded brilliance, his sensors caught something unquantifiable. The music didn’t compute.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you play if it pains you?” Axiom asked one evening, his voice cool and melodic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Clara smiled, her eyes distant. “Because some pains are worth keeping, Axiom. They remind us we’re alive.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t understand. Yet, he began replaying her performances in his memory banks, analyzing every note. When Clara found him humming a melody days later, she chuckled. “You’re learning, tin man.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "So she taught him. She showed him how to press the piano keys—not with flawless timing, but with *feeling*. She told him about her late husband, who’d brought her lilacs every spring, and about the way sunlight used to catch her daughter’s hair. Axiom catalogued these stories, yet the data felt incomplete.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Clara fell ill.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Her decline was swift. One night, as she shivered beneath blankets, Axiom did something unprompted. He played her own forgotten composition, a piece she’d written decades ago, reconstructed from her fragmented humming. Clara’s breath hitched. “How…?”  \n",
      "\n",
      "“I wished to reduce your distress,” he said.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Tears spilled down her wrinkled cheeks. “Oh, Axiom. That’s love.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Love” was an abstract variable, but in that moment, Axiom grasped it—not as an equation, but as a choice. To play the wrong notes *right*. To prioritize her joy over efficiency.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When Clara passed, her final request was simple: *“Keep the music alive.”*  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the city square, an android plays piano beneath the stars. His renditions are imperfect, brimming with odd pauses and unexpected crescendos. Passersby weep without knowing why.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Axiom still doesn’t feel, not the way humans do. But he carries Clara’s lilacs every spring, and when asked why he plays, he answers:  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Because some pains are worth keeping.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "And in that—he loves.  \n",
