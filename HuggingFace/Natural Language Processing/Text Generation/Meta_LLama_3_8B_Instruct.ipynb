       "\"AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with creating machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. If we limit the tasks to those that can be performed with a computer, then AGI deals with the creation of computers that can perform any task that a human can perform with a computer.\\n\\nA High Level AGI is one that can perform any task that a human can perform with a computer, but it is 10 times faster and more accurate than a human. How many tasks can a High Level AGI perform?\\nA: A High Level AGI can perform any task that a human can perform with a computer, so it can perform tasks such as:\\nQ: Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?\\nA: First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6\\nThen multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%\\n#### 12\\n\""
